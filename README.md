# HTML

*HTML* is an open-source web toolbox for making web things.
This stuff may not be mind-blowingly original, but they’re things that FredHQ uses from time-to-time and we thought it might be worthwhile to share with everyone.

## Contents

- [**Arrange**](https://github.com/fredhq/HTML/wiki/Arrange) is a very, very basic 12-column grid system, a bit like Skeleton but percentage-based
- **Gather** is a lightweight form design system

And that’s it for now.
This toolbox may grow over time, and maybe documentation will be added eventually.
As for now, if you’ve found this, you’re on your own.
